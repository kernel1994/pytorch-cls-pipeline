# Image classification pipeline with PyTorch

## Abstract
This code is a pipeline for classification and tested on MNIST dataset.

## Pipeline
The pipeline consists of five parts:
- data preparation
- model creation
- model training
- data prediction
- index evaluation

Entry: `main.py`

## TODO
- [ ] more detailed prediction records
- [ ] tensorboard display
- [ ] more evaluation metrics
- [ ] metrics plots
- [ ] cross validation
- [ ] train/ test phase switch
